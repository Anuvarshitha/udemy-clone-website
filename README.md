# udemy-clone-website
A responsive and visually appealing clone of the Udemy homepage built using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, including layout structuring, responsive design, and clean styling. It includes sections like navigation, featured courses, categories, and footer â€“ closely resembling the real Udemy interface.
